\title{Create Bus Route Survey Design}
\usage{
design_busroute(
  interviews,
  counts,
  calendar,
  route_schedule,
  strata_vars = c("date", "location"),
  weight_method = "unequal_prob"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{interviews}{A tibble containing interview data validated by validate_interviews().}

\item{counts}{A tibble containing count data validated by validate_counts().}

\item{calendar}{A tibble containing calendar data validated by validate_calendar().}

\item{route_schedule}{A tibble describing the bus route schedule (stop, time, expected coverage).}

\item{strata_vars}{Character vector of variables to use for stratification. Default is c("date", "location").}

\item{weight_method}{Character specifying weight calculation method. Options: "standard", "unequal_prob", "calibrate".}
}
\value{
A list object of class "busroute_design" and "creel_design".
}
\description{
Constructs a survey design object for bus route creel surveys, where surveyors follow a fixed route and sample anglers at multiple locations/times. This design accounts for unequal probability sampling and route-based coverage.

\examples{
# design_busroute(interviews, counts, calendar, route_schedule)
