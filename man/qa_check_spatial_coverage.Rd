  data,
  locations_expected = NULL,
  location_col = "location",

  type = c("counts", "interviews"),

\arguments{
\item{data}{Count or interview data}

\item{locations_expected}{Character vector of all locations that should be sampled.
If NULL, uses all unique locations found in data.}

\item{location_col}{Column containing location names (default "location")}

\item{date_col}{Column containing dates (default "date")}

\item{type}{Data type: \code{"counts"} or \code{"interviews"}}

\item{interviewer_col}{Column containing interviewer IDs (optional).
Used to check if interviewers cover all locations.}

\item{min_coverage}{Minimum acceptable coverage proportion (default 0.90)}

\item{min_sample_size}{Minimum sample size per location to avoid low-n warnings (default 10)}
}
\value{
List with:
\describe{
\item{issue_detected}{Logical, TRUE if coverage issues detected}
\item{severity}{"high", "medium", "low", or "none"}
\item{location_coverage}{Proportion of expected locations sampled}
\item{locations_observed}{Locations found in data}
\item{locations_missing}{Expected locations not in data}
\item{location_stats}{Sample sizes and temporal coverage by location}
\item{undersampled_locations}{Locations with sample size < min_sample_size}
\item{temporal_gaps}{Locations with poor temporal coverage}
\item{interviewer_coverage}{Coverage matrix by interviewer (if interviewer_col provided)}
\item{recommendation}{Text guidance for remediation}
}
}
\description{
Detects incomplete spatial coverage for both counts and interviews,
which creates unrepresentative samples and unknown bias (Table 17.3, #4-5).

\details{
\subsection{Detection Logic}{
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Location Coverage:}
\itemize{
\item Check which expected locations are missing entirely
\item Calculate proportion of locations covered
\item Flag if coverage < min_coverage
}
\item \strong{Sample Size Adequacy:}
\itemize{
\item Compare sample sizes among locations
\item Flag locations with very low sample sizes (< min_sample_size)
\item Check for extreme imbalance (CV > 1.0)
}
\item \strong{Temporal Coverage:}
\itemize{
\item For each location, check temporal span vs overall season
\item Flag locations with temporal coverage < 70\% of season
}
\item \strong{Interviewer Coverage (optional):}
\itemize{
\item Check if interviewers cover all locations
\item Flag if certain interviewers only work certain sites
}
}
}

\subsection{Severity Levels}{
\itemize{
\item \strong{High:} Missing >20\% of locations OR >50\% have low sample sizes
\item \strong{Medium:} Missing 10-20\% of locations OR 25-50\% have low sample sizes
\item \strong{Low:} Missing <10\% of locations OR <25\% have low sample sizes
\item \strong{None:} All locations covered with adequate samples
