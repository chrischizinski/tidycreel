\title{Extract replicate weights survey design from a repweights_design}
\usage{
as_svrep_design(design)
}
\arguments{
\item{design}{A \code{repweights_design} object}
}
\value{
A \code{survey::svrepdesign} object
}
\description{
Returns the embedded \code{survey::svrepdesign} object for bootstrap/jackknife/BRR designs.
}
\details{
Use this helper for advanced variance estimation and resampling-based inference.
Raises an error if no embedded svrepdesign is found.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Create a replicate weights design first
# (design_repweights is an internal function)
access_design <- design_access(interviews, calendar)
# Then extract the survey design for advanced use
# svyrep <- as_svrep_design(rep_design)
}
