\title{Check for Targeting Bias (Successful Parties)}
\usage{
qa_check_targeting(
  interviews,
  catch_col = "catch_total",
  location_col = NULL,
  interviewer_col = NULL,
  success_threshold = 0.85
)
}
\arguments{
\item{interviews}{Interview data}

\item{catch_col}{Column containing catch counts (default "catch_total")}

\item{location_col}{Column containing interview locations (optional).
Used to identify high-success locations like cleaning stations.}

\item{interviewer_col}{Column containing interviewer IDs (optional).
Used to detect interviewer-specific bias.}

\item{success_threshold}{Proportion of non-zero catches above which
targeting is suspected (default 0.85). Natural fisheries typically
have 30-70\% success rates.}
}
\value{
List with:
\describe{
\item{issue_detected}{Logical, TRUE if potential targeting detected}
\item{severity}{"high", "medium", "low", or "none"}
\item{overall_success_rate}{Proportion of interviews with catch > 0}
\item{expected_success_rate}{Expected range based on fishery type}
\item{location_stats}{Success rates by location (if location_col provided)}
\item{high_success_locations}{Locations with >90\% success (potential cleaning stations)}
\item{interviewer_stats}{Success rates by interviewer (if interviewer_col provided)}
\item{biased_interviewers}{Interviewers with significantly high success rates}
\item{recommendation}{Text guidance for remediation}
}
}
\description{
Detects potential targeting of successful fishing parties, which occurs
when interviewers preferentially interview anglers with visible fish
(e.g., at fish-cleaning stations). This leads to overestimation of catch
and harvest rates (Table 17.3, #2).

\details{
\subsection{Detection Logic}{
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Overall Success Rate:}
\itemize{
\item Calculate proportion of interviews with catch > 0
\item Flag if success rate > success_threshold (default 85\%)
\item Natural fisheries typically have 30-70\% success rates
\item Rates >85\% suggest potential targeting bias
}
\item \strong{Location-Specific Targeting:}
\itemize{
\item Identify locations with very high success rates (>90\%)
\item These may be fish-cleaning stations or boat ramps where successful
anglers congregate
\item Check if these locations are overrepresented in sample
}
\item \strong{Interviewer Bias:}
\itemize{
\item Compare success rates among interviewers
\item Flag interviewers with substantially higher success rates than average
\item Use statistical tests (chi-square) if sufficient sample size
}
}
}

\subsection{Severity Levels}{
\itemize{
\item \strong{High:} Success rate >90\% or >3 high-success locations
\item \strong{Medium:} Success rate 85-90\% or 1-2 high-success locations
\item \strong{Low:} Success rate 75-85\%
\item \strong{None:} Success rate <75\%
