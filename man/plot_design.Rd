\arguments{
\item{design}{A creel_design object or data frame with survey structure.}

\item{by}{Character vector of grouping variables (e.g., date, shift_block, location, stratum).}

\item{type}{Plot type: "bar", "facet", "interactive".}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to ggplot2 or plotly.}

\item{x}{A creel_design object}
}
\value{
A ggplot object

A ggplot or plotly object.

\description{
Visualizes the distribution of interviews by date, shift block, and location using ggplot2.

Visualize survey design by date, shift, location, stratum, or other grouping variables.
Supports bar plots, faceted plots, and interactive plots (via plotly if available).
}
\details{
Visualizes survey design structure and effort estimates. Supports bar, facet, and interactive plots. See vignettes for usage examples.
