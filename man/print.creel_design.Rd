\section{Design Assumptions}{

\itemize{
\item Random sampling within stratum: Each sampled unit is selected randomly within its stratum.
\item Strata are correctly defined to reflect true variation in effort and catch.
\item Complete coverage or known probabilities: All exiting anglers are interviewed, or inclusion probabilities are known.
\item Nonresponse is random or accounted for.
\item Effort and catch are accurately reported by anglers.
\item No double-counting: Each angler or party is counted/interviewed only once per sampling unit.
\item Replicate weights reflect true sampling variability.
Assumptions should be reviewed for each survey design. Violations may require adjustment or bias correction.
