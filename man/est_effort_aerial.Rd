\arguments{
\item{x}{Optional \code{creel_design} containing a \verb{$counts} component.}

\item{counts}{Data frame/tibble of aerial counts with at least \code{count} and a
minutes column (e.g., \code{flight_minutes}, \code{interval_minutes}, or \code{count_duration}).}

\item{by}{Character vector of grouping variables present in \code{counts}
(e.g., \code{date}, \code{location}). Missing columns are ignored with a warning.}

\item{minutes_col}{Candidate column names for minutes represented by each
count. The first present is used.}

\item{total_minutes_col}{Optional column giving the total minutes represented
for the whole day×group (e.g., full day length or block coverage). If
absent, the estimator falls back to the sum of per-count minutes within the
day×group (warns).}

\item{day_id}{Day identifier (PSU), typically \code{date}, used to join to the
survey design.}

\item{covariates}{Optional character vector of additional grouping variables
for aerial conditions (e.g., \code{cloud}, \code{glare}, \code{observer}, \code{altitude}).}

\item{visibility_col}{Optional name of a column with visibility proportion
(0–1). Counts are divided by this value (guarded to avoid division by very
small numbers).}

\item{calibration_col}{Optional name of a column with multiplicative
calibration factors to apply after visibility correction.}

\item{svy}{Optional \code{svydesign}/\code{svrepdesign} encoding the day sampling
design (must include \code{day_id} in \code{svy$variables}). When provided, totals,
SEs, and CIs are computed with \code{survey} functions.}

\item{conf_level}{Confidence level for Wald CIs (default 0.95).}
}
\description{
Accepts either a \code{creel_design} in \code{x} with embedded counts or a \code{counts}
data frame directly. Prefer \code{est_effort.aerial()} with \code{counts}.
