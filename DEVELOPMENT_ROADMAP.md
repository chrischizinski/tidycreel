## Top 15 Priority Features
### Reorganized Based on Chapter Analysis & User Needs

---

## PHASE 1 - Critical Operational Gaps (Next 8-10 weeks)

### 1. ðŸ”´ **Roving/Incomplete Trip Estimators** - HIGHEST PRIORITY

**Status:** Not implemented
**Priority:** P0 - One of the most common survey types
**Effort:** 2-3 weeks
**Chapter Reference:** Section 17.3.2, Box 18.5 (Pollock et al. 1997)

**Why Critical:**
- Roving surveys are extremely common (anglers interviewed while actively fishing)
- Current `est_cpue()` has basic incomplete trip handling but missing proper Pollock et al. methods
- Length-biased sampling correction needed
- Different variance formulas than access-point surveys

**Missing Components:**
- **Pollock et al. (1997) mean-of-ratios estimator** for incomplete trips
- **Trip length truncation** - systematic handling of very short trips (< 0.5 hrs)
- **Length-biased sampling correction** - longer trips more likely intercepted
- **Incomplete trip expansion** - proper handling when anglers still fishing
- **Separate variance formulas** for roving vs access-point

**Key Formulas:**
```r
# Roving (incomplete) - Mean of Ratios
rate_i = catch_i / effort_i  (for each party)
mean_rate = Î£(rate_i) / k
var_rate = [Î£(rate_iÂ²) - (Î£ rate_i)Â²/k] / [k(k-1)]

# MUST truncate trips < 0.5 hours (Hoenig et al. 1997)
```

**Implementation Plan:**
```r
est_cpue_roving(
  interviews,
  response = "catch_total",
  effort_col = "hours_fished",
  min_trip_hours = 0.5,              # Truncation threshold
  correction = c("none", "length_biased"),  # Length-biased sampling
  by = NULL,
  svy = NULL,
  conf_level = 0.95
)

# Or enhance existing est_cpue()
est_cpue(
  ...,
  interview_type = c("complete", "incomplete", "mixed"),
  apply_truncation = TRUE,
  length_bias_correction = FALSE
)
```

**Testing:**
- Compare to Pollock et al. examples
- Validate truncation effects
- Test variance formulas against access-point method
- Integration with `est_total_harvest()`

**Documentation:**
- Vignette: "Roving vs Access-Point Surveys"
- When to use each method
- Variance implications
- Best practices for field implementation

**Success Metrics:**
- Matches Pollock et al. (1997) examples
- Users can analyze roving survey data correctly
- Proper variance estimation for incomplete trips

---

### 2. ðŸ”´ **Quality Assurance/Quality Control Framework**

**Status:** Basic schemas only
**Priority:** P0 - Data quality issues extremely common
**Effort:** 2-3 weeks
**Chapter Reference:** Section 17.2.2, Table 17.3

**Why Critical:**
- Table 17.3 lists 10 common mistakes in creel surveys
- Current package only validates basic data schemas
- No systematic checks for common errors
- Users need guidance to avoid biased estimates

**Common Mistakes to Detect (Table 17.3):**
1. **Skipping zeros** - Creel clerks only recording when anglers present
2. **Targeting successful parties** - Interviewing at cleaning stations
3. **Measuring biggest fish only** - Size structure bias
4. **Counts don't cover entire area** - Spatial coverage gaps
5. **Interviews exclude groups** - Non-response bias
6. **Mixing measurement units** - Inches vs mm, hours vs minutes
7. **Species misidentification** - Data quality issues
8. **Party-level effort errors** - Accounting for multiple anglers
9. **Lack of standardized training** - Data inconsistency
10. **No QA-QC procedures** - Compounding errors

**Implementation:**
```r
qa_checks(
  counts = NULL,
  interviews = NULL,
  schedule = NULL,
  checks = c(
    "zero_counts",         # Flag if no zero counts recorded
    "successful_bias",     # Detect interviewing only at cleaning stations
    "measurement_units",   # Check unit consistency
    "party_effort",        # Validate multi-angler party effort
    "coverage",           # Verify counts covered entire waterbody
    "outliers",           # Statistical outlier detection
    "species_id",         # Flag uncommon species combinations
    "missing_data",       # Completeness checks
    "temporal_coverage",  # All strata sampled
    "interview_location"  # Location bias assessment
  ),
  severity = c("error", "warning", "info")
)

# Generate comprehensive report
qc_report(
  data,
  qa_results,
  output_format = c("html", "pdf", "console"),
  include_recommendations = TRUE
)

# Validation functions
validate_counts(counts, design_type, check_design_requirements = TRUE)
validate_interviews(interviews, survey_type, check_consistency = TRUE)
validate_schedule(schedule, calendar, check_allocation = TRUE)
```

**Testing:**

**Key Formula:**
```r
# Strata estimator with variance decomposition
var(Y_stratum) = ((1 - n/N)/n) * s_bÂ² + (1/(2N)) * s_wÂ²

where:
  s_bÂ² = among-day variance
  s_wÂ² = within-day variance (from multiple counts)
  n = days sampled
  N = total days in stratum
```

**Implementation:**
```r
decompose_variance(
  effort_est,  # Output from est_effort()
  level = c("shift", "day", "stratum", "month"),
  components = c("within_day", "among_day", "within_shift")
)

# Output includes:
# - Variance components table
# - Intraclass correlation
# - Design effects
# - Optimal allocation recommendations
# - Variance ratio (for sample size planning)

# Visualize variance components
plot_variance_components(
  variance_decomp,

  pilot_data = NULL,              # Or provide pilot data directly
  allocation = c("proportional", "optimal", "equal"),
  strata = c("weekday", "weekend", "highuse"),
  budget_constraint = NULL,
  cost_per_day = NULL
)

# Power analysis for trend detection
calc_power_creel(

  years = 5,
  alpha = 0.05,
  days_per_stratum,

  estimate_detection = TRUE        # Adjust for differential detection
)

# Enhanced estimation with segmentation
est_effort_segmented(
  counts,
  interviews,
  segments,
  adjust_detection = TRUE,
  test_differences = TRUE,         # Test if segments differ significantly
  by = NULL,
  svy = NULL
)

# Assess non-response bias by segment

  counts,
  segments,
  methods = c("comparison", "sensitivity", "bounds")
)

# Automatic bank vs boat separation
