# Introduction

This vignette demonstrates how to estimate fishing effort using design-based methods in creel surveys with the tidycreel package. It covers instantaneous, progressive (bus-route), aerial, and roving estimators, with practical examples and guidance on grouping, diagnostics, and variance estimation.

# Example Data

```r
library(tidycreel)
library(tibble)

# Simulated instantaneous count data
inst_counts <- tibble(
  date = as.Date(c("2025-08-20", "2025-08-20", "2025-08-21")),
  time = c("12:00", "14:00", "13:00"),
  count = c(10, 12, 8),
  interval_minutes = c(60, 60, 60),
  location = c("A", "A", "B")
)
```

# Instantaneous Estimator

```r
est_effort.instantaneous(inst_counts)
```

# Progressive (Bus-Route) Estimator

```r
bus_counts <- tibble(
  date = as.Date(rep("2025-08-20", 4)),
  time = c("08:00", "10:00", "12:00", "14:00"),
  count = c(5, 8, 10, 12),
  interval_minutes = c(30, 30, 30, 30),
  location = c("A", "A", "B", "B")
)
est_effort.progressive(bus_counts)
```

# Aerial Estimator

```r
aerial_counts <- tibble(
  date = as.Date(rep("2025-08-20", 3)),
  time = c("09:00", "11:00", "13:00"),
  count = c(15, 18, 20),
  interval_minutes = c(45, 45, 45),
  location = c("A", "B", "B")
)
est_effort.aerial(aerial_counts)
```

# Roving Estimator

```r
roving_counts <- tibble(
  date = as.Date(rep("2025-08-21", 2)),
  time = c("10:00", "12:00"),
  count = c(7, 9),
  interval_minutes = c(60, 60),
  location = c("A", "B")
)
est_effort.roving(roving_counts)
```

# Diagnostics and Grouping

All estimators provide diagnostics and handle missing grouping columns gracefully. For best results, include all expected grouping columns in your data.

# Variance and Confidence Intervals

Effort estimates include standard errors and confidence intervals when multiple groups are present. For single-group cases, SE and CI are set to NA.

# Advanced Features

See the package todo for planned enhancements, including visibility correction and calibration for aerial surveys.
