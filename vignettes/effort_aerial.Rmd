# Aerial Survey Effort Estimation in tidycreel

This vignette demonstrates how to estimate fishing effort using aerial survey data in the `tidycreel` package, including visibility correction, calibration, stratified expansion, and variance estimation.

## Example Data

```r
library(tidycreel)
library(dplyr)

# Simulated aerial counts
aerial_counts <- tibble::tibble(
  date = rep(as.Date('2025-08-01'), 6),
  location = rep(c('A', 'B'), each = 3),
  stratum = rep(1:3, 2),
  count = c(20, 15, 10, 25, 18, 12),
  visibility = c(0.8, 0.9, 0.85, 0.75, 0.8, 0.9),
  calibration = c(1.05, 1.00, 0.98, 1.10, 1.02, 1.00)
)

aerial_design <- list(type = "aerial", strata = unique(aerial_counts$stratum))
class(aerial_design) <- c("creel_design", "list")
```

## Estimation with Visibility and Calibration Correction

```r
result <- est_effort_aerial(
  x = aerial_design,
  counts = aerial_counts,
  visibility_correction = "visibility",
  calibration_factor = "calibration",
  by = c("date", "location", "stratum"),
  variance_method = "bootstrap",
  conf_level = 0.95
)
result
```

## Output Structure

- `estimate`: Visibility- and calibration-adjusted effort per stratum
- `se`: Standard error (bootstrap)
- `ci_low`, `ci_high`: Confidence interval
- `n`: Number of counts per stratum
- `method`: "aerial"
- `diagnostics`: Diagnostics column (future expansion)

## Notes

- Visibility correction adjusts for detection probability (e.g., observer bias, weather).
- Calibration factors integrate ground truth or reference counts.
- Stratified expansion allows for aggregation by date, location, and stratum.
- Variance estimation supports analytic, bootstrap, and jackknife methods.
