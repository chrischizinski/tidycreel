The goal of tidycreel is to provide a survey-first, tidy interface for creel survey design and analysis. Estimators are built on the `survey`/`svrepdesign` framework with vectorized, tidyverse data workflows, delivering defensible estimates of effort, CPUE, catch, and harvest.

## Installation

You can install the development version of tidycreel from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("chrischizinski/tidycreel")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(tidycreel)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.

## Effort Overview (Survey-First)

- Instantaneous and Progressive (roving) estimators aggregate to day Ã— group totals and use a day-PSU design for inference. See the vignette:

``` r
vignette("effort_survey_first", package = "tidycreel")
```

- Aerial snapshot counts with covariates, post-stratification, and calibration are covered here:

``` r
vignette("aerial", package = "tidycreel")
```

Tip: For replicate variance, convert your day design with `survey::as.svrepdesign()` and pass it to the estimators.

## Guides and Vignettes

- Survey terms in creel context: a translator

``` r
vignette("survey_creel_terms", package = "tidycreel")
```

- Replicate designs (bootstrap/jackknife/BRR) for creel inference

``` r
vignette("replicate_designs_creel", package = "tidycreel")
```
