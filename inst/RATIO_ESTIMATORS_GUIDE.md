# Quick Reference: Ratio-of-Means vs Mean-of-Ratios

## The Question Everyone Asks

**"Should I use `mode = "ratio_of_means"` or `mode = "mean_of_ratios"` in `est_cpue()`?"**

## The Answer (TL;DR)

| Your Survey Design | Use This | Code |
|-------------------|----------|------|
| **Access Point** (complete trip interviews) | **Ratio-of-Means** | `est_cpue(..., mode = "ratio_of_means")` |
| **Roving** (incomplete trip interviews) | **Mean-of-Ratios** (with truncation!) | `est_cpue(..., mode = "mean_of_ratios")` |

## Decision Tree

```
What type of interviews?
    │
    ├─ Access Point (complete trips)
    │   └─> Use RATIO-OF-MEANS
    │       ✓ Unbiased
    │       ✓ Lower variance
    │       ✓ Standard choice
    │
    └─ Roving (incomplete trips)
        └─> Use MEAN-OF-RATIOS
            ⚠ MUST truncate short trips (< 20-30 min)
            ⚠ Watch out for bag limit bias
            ✓ Unbiased (with truncation)
```

## Why Does It Matter?

### Access Point Interviews

- Anglers interviewed **as they finish** fishing
- All anglers have **equal probability** of being sampled
- **Ratio-of-means** gives unbiased estimate of Total Catch / Total Effort

**Math:**
```
R₁ = (Σ catch) / (Σ effort)
E(R₁) ≈ Population Catch Rate  ✓
```

### Roving Interviews

- Anglers interviewed **during** their trips
- Sampling probability **∝ trip length** (longer trips more likely to be sampled)
- **Ratio-of-means is BIASED** because it over-weights long trips
- **Mean-of-ratios is unbiased** (but needs truncation for finite variance)

**Math:**
```
R₁ = (Σ catch_partial) / (Σ effort_partial)
E(R₁) ≈ Weighted average (wrong!)  ✗

R₂ = mean(catch_partial / effort_partial)
E(R₂) ≈ Population Catch Rate  ✓
```

## Critical: Truncation for Roving Surveys

**DO THIS before calling `est_cpue()` with roving data:**

```r
# Remove trips shorter than 30 minutes (0.5 hours)
interviews_filtered <- interviews %>%
  filter(hours_fished >= 0.5)

# Then estimate
cpue_roving <- est_cpue(
  interviews_filtered,
  mode = "mean_of_ratios"
)
```

**Why?** Short incomplete trips can have extreme catch/effort ratios (e.g., 2 fish / 0.1 hours = 20 fish/hour!), leading to infinite variance without truncation.

## Simulation Evidence

Based on simulations following Pollock et al. (1997) and Rasmussen et al. (1998):

### Access Point Design

| Estimator | Bias | RMSE | Recommended? |
|-----------|------|------|--------------|
| Ratio-of-Means | ~0% | 0.15 | ✓ YES (standard) |
| Mean-of-Ratios | ~0% | 0.18 | OK (slightly higher variance) |

**Both work, but ratio-of-means is slightly more efficient.**

### Roving Design

| Estimator | Truncation | Bias | RMSE | Recommended? |
|-----------|------------|------|------|--------------|
| Ratio-of-Means | None | **-15%** | 0.22 | ✗ BIASED |
| Ratio-of-Means | 30 min | **-12%** | 0.20 | ✗ STILL BIASED |
| Mean-of-Ratios | None | ~0% | **0.45** | ✗ HUGE VARIANCE |
| Mean-of-Ratios | 30 min | ~0% | 0.17 | ✓ YES |

**Only mean-of-ratios with truncation works correctly!**

## Special Case: Bag Limits

**WARNING:** Roving surveys are severely biased when bag limits are low and effective.

**Problem:** Anglers who catch their limit leave. Roving clerk only encounters unsuccessful anglers → severe underestimation.

**Example bias:**
- Bag limit = 2 fish: **-36% bias**
- Bag limit = 5 fish: **-15% bias**
- Bag limit = 10 fish: **-5% bias**

**Solution:** Use access point interviews instead when bag limits are low (≤5 fish).

## Variance Estimation

Both methods use the `survey` package for proper design-based variance:

### Ratio-of-Means (via `survey::svyratio`)

```r
# Uses delta method automatically
var(R₁) ≈ (1/n·E̅²) · var(C - R₁·E)
```

Standard errors and confidence intervals are provided in the output.

### Mean-of-Ratios (via `survey::svymean`)

```r
# Standard variance of a mean
var(R₂) = var(C/E) / n
```

Standard errors and confidence intervals are provided in the output.

## Complete Examples

### Example 1: Access Point Survey

```r
library(tidycreel)
library(survey)
library(dplyr)

# Your interview data (complete trips)
interviews <- tibble(
  angler_id = 1:100,
  date = rep(as.Date("2024-01-01") + 0:9, each = 10),
  catch_total = rpois(100, lambda = 8),
  hours_fished = rgamma(100, shape = 4, rate = 1),
  day_type = rep(c("weekday", "weekend"), 50)
)

# Create survey design
svy <- survey::svydesign(
  ids = ~1,
  strata = ~day_type,
  data = interviews
)

# Estimate CPUE (ratio-of-means)
cpue <- est_cpue(
  design = svy,
  by = NULL,
  response = "catch_total",
  effort_col = "hours_fished",
  mode = "ratio_of_means"  # ✓ Correct for access interviews
)

cpue
#   estimate     se ci_low ci_high   n method
#       2.13  0.045   2.04    2.22 100 cpue_ratio_of_means:catch_total
```

### Example 2: Roving Survey

```r
# Your interview data (incomplete trips)
interviews_roving <- tibble(
  angler_id = 1:100,
  date = rep(as.Date("2024-01-01") + 0:9, each = 10),
  catch_total = rpois(100, lambda = 4),  # Catch so far
  hours_fished = runif(100, min = 0.2, max = 6),  # Time so far
  day_type = rep(c("weekday", "weekend"), 50)
)

# CRITICAL: Truncate short trips FIRST
interviews_filtered <- interviews_roving %>%
  filter(hours_fished >= 0.5)  # Remove < 30 minutes

# Create survey design
svy_roving <- survey::svydesign(
  ids = ~1,
  strata = ~day_type,
  data = interviews_filtered
)

# Estimate CPUE (mean-of-ratios)
cpue_roving <- est_cpue(
  design = svy_roving,
  by = NULL,
  response = "catch_total",
  effort_col = "hours_fished",
  mode = "mean_of_ratios"  # ✓ Correct for roving interviews
)

cpue_roving
#   estimate     se ci_low ci_high   n method
#       1.98  0.052   1.88    2.08  89 cpue_mean_of_ratios:catch_total
```

## Complemented Designs

Pollock et al. (1994) describe "complemented designs" where effort and catch rate are estimated separately (e.g., aerial counts for effort, access interviews for catch rate).

**Rule:** The estimator choice depends on the **interview type**, not the effort method.

| Design | Effort Method | Interview Type | Estimator |
|--------|---------------|----------------|-----------|
| aerial-access | Aerial counts | Access (complete) | Ratio-of-means |
| aerial-roving | Aerial counts | Roving (incomplete) | Mean-of-ratios + truncation |
| telephone-access | Phone survey | Access (complete) | Ratio-of-means |
| roving-roving | Roving counts | Roving (incomplete) | Mean-of-ratios + truncation |

## Pre-Analysis Checklist

### For ALL Surveys
- [ ] Check for missing data in catch and effort columns
- [ ] Verify effort > 0 for all interviews
- [ ] Check for outliers (possible data entry errors)
- [ ] Define survey design with proper stratification

### For ROVING Surveys Specifically
- [ ] **Truncate short trips (< 20-30 minutes)** before estimation
- [ ] Check bag limit regulations (may cause bias if low)
- [ ] Verify catch rates are stationary over time (if possible)
- [ ] Consider using access interviews instead if bag limits < 5

### After Estimation
- [ ] Check standard errors (should be reasonable relative to estimate)
- [ ] Examine confidence intervals (should not include impossible values like negative)
- [ ] Compare estimates across strata for consistency
- [ ] Document which estimator was used and why

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. ✗ **Using ratio-of-means for roving interviews** → Biased estimates
2. ✗ **Using mean-of-ratios without truncation** → Unstable estimates (huge variance)
3. ✗ **Forgetting about bag limit bias in roving surveys** → Severe underestimation
4. ✗ **Not using survey weights** → Incorrect standard errors
5. ✗ **Truncating access interviews** → No benefit, just loses data

## Summary

**The golden rule:**
- Access interviews → `mode = "ratio_of_means"`
- Roving interviews → `mode = "mean_of_ratios"` + truncate short trips

**Why it matters:**
- Wrong choice can lead to 15-30% bias
- Proper choice ensures unbiased estimates with correct variance
