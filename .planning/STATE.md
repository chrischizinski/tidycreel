## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Three-layer architecture (API → Orchestration → Survey): Separates domain translation from statistics
- Design-centric API: Everything flows through creel_design object
- Start from empty package: Clean slate faster than refactoring v1
- Build instantaneous counts first: Simplest design type proves architecture

**From 01-01:**
- Minimal Phase 1 dependencies only (checkmate, cli, rlang) - other packages added incrementally
- Placeholder test prevents testthat errors in empty package
- V1 development artifacts excluded via .Rbuildignore rather than deleted
- Removed Maintainer field from DESCRIPTION (auto-generated from Authors@R)
