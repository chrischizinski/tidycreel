# The original issue asked for one live endpoint. That would have told us
# whether ONE agency's payload decodes, which is not a property of this package
# -- and it left the question blocked behind a credential nobody had. The
# question worth answering is the general one: of the JSON shapes an API is
# entitled to return, which does this connection read correctly, which does it
# refuse, and is there any it reads WRONGLY? Only the third kind matters, and a
# local server can enumerate all three.
#
# See helper-api-shapes.R for the payloads. Every route on that server returns
# the same three records; only the wrapper differs.
