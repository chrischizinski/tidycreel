# Tests for GH #185: the DBI backend actually loads data.
#
# WHY these tests exist
#
# The backend opened a real connection and reported itself open, while every
# fetch_*() off it aborted as unimplemented. test-sqlserver-not-implemented.R
# pinned those aborts so that implementing them would fail and prompt the docs
# to be corrected in the same change; this file replaces it.
#
# The load is only ever one stage: read the named table. Rename, coercion,
# value maps and validation are shared with the CSV backend and untouched. The
# parity tests below are the ones that matter, because they are what would fail
# if the DBI path ever grew its own copy of a stage the CSV path already owns.
