# Source vocabularies through the fetch layer (GH #128).
#
# Every downstream filter matches a canonical literal: "complete" for trip
# filtering, "harvested" for harvest aggregation, "harvest"/"release" for length
# type. A source that codes these columns -- "1"/"2", "H"/"R" -- had no way to
# say what its codes meant, so the caller had to recode by hand between the
# fetch and add_interviews(). That hand recode is the risk: an undeclared third
# code gets folded into whichever of the two the caller happened to think of,
# and nothing says so.
#
# These tests pin the translation, and pin that an undeclared code is refused
# rather than passed along.
