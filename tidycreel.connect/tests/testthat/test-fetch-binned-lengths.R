# Binned release lengths through the fetch layer (GH #127).
#
# A binned length row is frequency-weighted: a row saying "350-400, 5 fish" is
# five fish, not one. The fetch layer carried no count column at all, so every
# binned source arrived one-row-per-bin and any distribution built from it was
# weighted by row multiplicity instead of by fish -- a believable number, no
# error, no warning. It also had nowhere to put a bin label except `length_mm`,
# where .coerce_numeric() turned it into NA, or where it silently rested a
# millimetre unit on a group label.
#
# These tests pin the fish-count arithmetic end to end, not just the presence of
# the columns: a count that is carried but ignored looks identical at the seam.
