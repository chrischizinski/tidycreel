# Helper: construct a creel_connection_api fixture for API backend tests.
#
# Every endpoint path and field name below is invented. The package ships none
# for any organisation's API, so a test connection has to describe one, exactly
# as a user does -- which is also what keeps these tests from encoding anyone's
# real schema.
#
# Tests wrap their calls in httr2::local_mocked_responses() to intercept HTTP.
