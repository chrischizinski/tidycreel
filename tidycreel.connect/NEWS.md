# tidycreel.connect 0.2.0

## Bug fixes and robustness improvements

* `creel_connect_from_yaml()`: guards against NULL/non-list config block after
  `config::get()`; catches missing credential keys (not just empty strings);
  validates `survey_type` against known enum before calling `creel_schema()`;
  wraps `DBI::dbConnect()` in `tryCatch()` to prevent password leaking into
  error tracebacks.
* `creel_connect()`: `creel_connect_csv()` now validates all 5 required path
  keys (`interviews`, `counts`, `catch`, `harvest_lengths`, `release_lengths`)
  before checking file existence, giving a clear error on missing keys.
* `.api_fetch()`: guards against NULL endpoint key with a clear error; wraps
  `as.data.frame()` for non-tabular API JSON responses; `.parse_api_date()`
  now strips ISO 8601 timezone suffixes (`Z`, `+HH:MM`, `-HH:MM`) before
  parsing, preventing silent NA on timezone-aware timestamps.
* `fetch_interviews()`, `fetch_counts()`, `fetch_catch()`,
  `fetch_harvest_lengths()`, `fetch_release_lengths()`: all `as.numeric()` and
  `as.Date()` coercions on data columns now warn when values cannot be parsed
  rather than silently producing `NA` (via new `.coerce_numeric()` and
  `.coerce_date()` internal helpers).
* `list_creels()`: missing NGPC API fields now trigger a warning and are filled
  with typed `NA` rather than silently producing a short-column data frame;
  return type unified to tibble across empty and non-empty responses.
* Validation (`fetch-validators`): `switch()` default now `stop()`s on unknown
  `expected_type` values rather than silently returning `TRUE`; UID columns
  (`interview_uid`, `catch_uid`, `length_uid`) use new `"uid"` type that
  accepts numeric or character (covers both synthesized row-index UIDs and UUID
  strings), replacing the unchecked `"any"` type.

# tidycreel.connect 0.1.0

## Initial release

* `creel_connect()` — unified connection constructor for CSV and SQL Server
  (DBI/ODBC) backends. Accepts a `creel_schema` column-mapping contract and
  returns a `creel_connection` S3 object.
* `creel_connect_from_yaml()` — YAML-based connection with fail-fast
  validation. Supports `backend: csv` and `backend: sqlserver`. Credentials
  injected via `config` package `!expr Sys.getenv()` tag.
* `auth_type` parameter — platform guard aborts immediately on macOS/Linux
  when `auth_type: windows` is requested, with actionable install instructions.
* `fetch_interviews()`, `fetch_counts()`, `fetch_catch()`,
  `fetch_harvest_lengths()`, `fetch_release_lengths()` — S3-dispatched data
  loaders for CSV and SQL Server backends. All coerce date columns to
  `Date` and species codes to `character` regardless of source type.
* `creel_check_driver()` — diagnostic helper that lists installed ODBC drivers
  and confirms a SQL Server driver is available.
* Getting-started vignette covering YAML config, schema setup, both backends,
  and credential security.
* Platform-specific ODBC driver install instructions in README (Windows,
  macOS, Linux).
